#+title:  Weekly report for 7th to 14th November 2022

** Overview

Thanks again to [[https://opensrcsec.com/][Open Source Security, inc]] and [[https://www.embecosm.com/][Embecosm]] for their ongoing support for this project.

*** Milestone Progress

The last week was spent on some big refactors and improvements which have not been merged yet, but should land soon.

We had our community call, for which you can find the agenda and minutes [[https://hackmd.io/NNpefWC_QgawvIpNcYpFZw?view][here]].

We received many v3 reviews from [[https://github.com/rguenth][Richard Biener]], which we appreciate greatly. The next week will be dedicated to fixing the issues mentioned and creating a new v4 of the patchset. The deadline for sending out the patches was yesterday, which we met. We now need to be extremely reactive regarding reviews.

We have closed out the ~Initial Upstream patches~ milestone as none of the remaining issues were particularly critical to the 13th of November deadline, and can be fixed before before the final merging period in April. All of the critical issues have been addressed and fixed.
